Her research focuses on the intertwined domains of (resting-state) neuroscience and lateralization/handedness. During her PhD, she has also been involved in Open Science events, either as part of the organizing committee (BrainHack Ghent <a href="https://brainhackghent.wixsite.com/brainhackghent/submitted-projects">2017</a>/<a href="https://brainhackghent.github.io/">2018</a>) or as a volunteer (Pint of Science, Ghent).

  <p align="justify" style="font-family: arial;"><br>Daniele Marinazzo is an associate professor in the Department of Data Analysis of the Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences at Ghent University. His team focuses on methodological and computational aspects of neuroscience research, and on the dynamical networks subserving function, as well as thorough statistical validation of the results. They develop new techniques for inferring connectivity architectures from the dynamics of the recorded data, in challenging cases of short, noisy and redundant time series, as those encountered in neuroimaging. Daniele cares about open science and ways to improve the review/editorial process. He is an editor at several journals in his field, including PLOS Computational Biology, PLOS One, NeuroImage, Brain Topography, Network Neuroscience.

She is now completing her thesis within the Donders Graduate School, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behavior, Nijmegen, the Netherlands. Her research concerns developing new methods for connectomics in the domain of cognitive neuroimaging, i.e. for functional and effective connectivity research. Natalia also currently holds a position of a Career Development and Mentoring Manager within the <a href="https://www.ohbmtrainees.com/">Organization for Human Brain Mapping Student and Postdoc Special Interest Group</a>, and serves as an eLife Associate within the <a href="https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/a946c355/elife-community-ambassadors-243-volunteers-join-the-programme-in-2019">eLife Ambassadors community</a>.

    Tim van Mourik is a PostDoc at the Donders Centre for Cognitive Neuroimaging. During his PhD he developed analysis tools to analyse fRMI scans at an even finer level of detail: that of the cortical layers. In doing so, he not only developed the new tools for obtaining laminar signals, but also applications to build graphical pipelines with these tools (<a href="https://timvanmourik.github.io/Porcupine/">Porcupine</a>). In addition, he set up web applications to facilitate sharing fMRI results in augmented reality ()<a href="https://armadillo-brain.herokuapp.com">ARmadillo</a>) and improve collaboration on interactive workflows (<a href="https://giraffe.tools">GiraffeTools</a>). At the OHBM conference 2019, Tim was the chair of the Open Science Room and in charge of organising a week long program with talks, discussions, and demos towards open and reproducible research practices.
