  <p align="justify" style="font-family: arial;"><br>Marjan Bakker is an assistant professor at the Methods and Statistics Department at Tilburg University. She is part of the Meta-Research Center in Tilburg at which they study the scientific system in psychology; in general to find its flaws and empirically test potential solutions. She wants to improve science by investigating problems and possible solutions. Her interests consist of reporting errors, the use of questionable research practices, statistical power, outliers in data, publication bias, and preregistration. Currently, she is mainly working on some larger projects on preregistration and on a project to replicate Mahoney’s seminal study on publication bias (for which she got an NWO replication grant).</p>

  <p align="justify" style="font-family: arial;"><br>Cass is a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Oxford Department of Psychiatry. She provides support for (f)MRI experimental design and analysis in the investigation of treatments for mood disorders. In this role, she has to stay up to speed with the leading edge of analytic tools, and is constantly on the lookout for tips, tricks, and techniques to make this research quicker, slicker, and more effective. This goes hand-in-hand with making the research more transparent and reproducible, and freely sharing the outputs of our labour. She is a contributor to <a href="https://the-turing-way.netlify.com/introduction/introduction">The Turing Way</a> and works with the <a href="https://www.win.ox.ac.uk/open-neuroimaging/open-neuroimaging-project">Wellcome Centre for Integrative Neuroimaging Open Community Team</a>.

She will show examples of p-hacking and will discuss the surprising fraction of confirmed hypotheses. This is not only a problem in psychology attested by examples of failure to replicate studies in other fields.

  <p align="justify" style="font-family: arial;"><br><b>Analytical Flexibility and Questionable Research Practices in MRI</b><br><br>The number of methods available for MRI analysis is growing every year. Each of these methods requires the specification of a bewildering array of parameters, not all of which are amenable to optimisation by consensus. The combination of these factors leads to an almost infinite number of ways in which we may analyse our data, and accordingly an infinite number of results which we may choose to report, or not. In this talk, I will discuss concerns of such analytic flexibility and the draw of questionable research practices to help uncover the "publishable story" in our data. I will present recent developments in our discipline which may assist the identification of robust effects, and what individual actions we may take in order to retain confidence in our own findings.</p>

  <p align="justify" style="font-family: arial;"><br><b>Open Science in the Context of Companies, Intellectual Property, and Collaborative Research</b><br><br>There is an interesting interplay between open science practices in publicly funded research and intellectual property and patenting in for-profit companies. This especially comes to light when such research institutions and companies collaborate, which is often the case in MRI-related work. For example, both companies and universities could be doing interesting and important work together, but apparent goals might differ: for universities it might be to publish papers and adhere to funding criteria; for companies it might be to secure a patent and monetize the work. Do these approaches necessarily contradict each other? How should they co-exist (if they can)? What should companies be doing, if anything, to improve or interact with open science practices? What should universities and research institutions be doing, if anything, to engage with companies in open science practices. This talk will explore these questions.</p>

  <p align="justify" style="font-family: arial;"><br><b>The Open Source Imaging Initiative</b><br><br>MR technology is one of the most powerful medical tools ever made, yet it is not available in many places around the world. How can we change that? Make the technology cheaper? Would be a good start, but it is not enough! We need sustainable long term solutions. By applying the open-source strategy it is possible to use the immense potential of the research community in a more efficient way by means of collaboration. This will trigger innovation, customization, and cost-efficiency, but will also lead to local/regional production and knowhow transfer into regions that desperately need it. An open source strategy would furthermore diffuse into all important areas of our healthcare system, such as: technological optimization, scientific progress, regulatory harmonization, democratized markets, device safety, global health, education, and many more. Not less than that is our vision of the Open Source Imaging Initiative (OSI²) with our communication platform: <a href="http://www.opensourceimaging.org./">www.opensourceimaging.org</a>. We focus on sharing and not competing, because this is healthier to all of us. In this presentation we will give an update on the workings of OSI², what happened so far and what is about to happen very soon.<br><br><b>Spoiler alert</b>: The world's first open source hardware standard will be released soon and we are preparing the open source documentation of a first open source hardware MRI that makes quite decent images. Our efforts are on a voluntary basis and we are open to all who want to join and who support our vision.</p>

  <p align="justify" style="font-family: arial;"><br><b>Current and Future Scenarios for Open Scientific Publishing and Reviewing</b><br><br>Communicating our research is a fundamental part of our work as scientists, and a duty towards the society. Typically this communication happens through articles published in scientific journals, after having been reviewed by our peers. We will discuss several aspects of scholarly communication and in particular of scientific publishing and peer review. Some of these aspects are (un-)surprisingly in clear contrast with the idea of science as an open and collaborative public mission. Several solutions and improvements have been proposed and sometimes implemented over the years; on some of them there’s wide consensus, on others there is not. And even when there is consensus to change, the change is slow. We will explore the state of the art and different future perspectives, and discuss our experiences and expectations.</p>

  <p align="justify" style="font-family: arial;"><br><b>The Turing Way: Reproducible, Inclusive, Collaborative Data Science</b><br><br>Reproducible research is necessary to ensure that scientific work can be trusted. By sharing data, analysis code, and the computational environment used to generate the results, researchers can more effectively stand on the shoulders of their peers and colleagues and deliver high quality, trustworthy, and verifiable outputs. This requires skills in data management, library sciences, software development, and continuous integration techniques: skills that are not widely taught or expected of academic researchers. Skills that are unreasonable, in fact, to expect in one individual team member.<br><br>The Turing Way is a handbook to support students, their supervisors, funders, and journal editors in ensuring that reproducible research is "too easy not to do". It includes training material on version control, analysis testing, collaborating in distributed groups, open and transparent communication skills, and effective management of diverse research projects. The Turing Way is openly developed and any and all questions, comments, and recommendations are welcome at our GitHub repository: <a href="https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way">https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way</a>.<br><br>In this talk, Kirstie Whitaker, lead developer of The Turing Way, will take you on a whirlwind tour of the chapters that already exist, the interactive demonstrations you can use and re-use for your own research, and the directions in which we're continuing to develop. All participants will leave the talk knowing that "Every Little Helps" when making their work reproducible, where to ask for help as they start or continue their open research journey, and how they can contribute to improve The Turing Way for future readers.</p>

  <p align="justify" style="font-family: arial;"><br><b>Reproducibility in Decoded: Case Studies from Data-Intensive Sciences</b><br><br>Reproducibility in research is one of the main building blocks of the scientific method. However, there is rising concern about reproducibility in current scientific research that reduces the reliability of published findings in various domains. In this workshop, we will learn about the tools and practices that will help us to improve the reproducibility of our own research pipeline. Based on the book <a href="https://www.practicereproducibleresearch.org/">The Practice of Reproducible research</a>, I will first introduce reproducible research workflows by providing case-study examples. In the second part, participants will walk through their own research pipeline and create their own reproducible research workflow. In small working groups, participants will reflect on their own computational practices and learn how they can improve the reproducibility of their own research workflow.</p>

  <p align="justify" style="font-family: arial;"><br><b>Software Version Control with git and GitHub</b><br><br>GIT is a tool to keep track of the successive versions of your code: from different pilot experiments to the final version or for different stages of your analysis pipeline. A side effect of using GIT is that it can also improve how you organize your code. When associated with GitHub, this also facilitates collaboration with others on the same codebase, automation of many tasks, and can help you streamline your workflow.
GIT and GitHub are potentially very powerful tools but tend to have a steep learning curve associated with a confusing and obscure terminology. This 2 hours workshop will not turn you into GIT and GitHub wizards but it should 1) make the terminology less scary so that you won’t be as confused when you try it on your own, 2) guide you on how to version control some simple code, 3) guide you on how to use some of GitHub’s functions by quikly creating your own academic website (e.g. <a href="https://academicpages.github.io/">https://academicpages.github.io/</a>).</p>

  <p align="justify" style="font-family: arial;"><br><b>Introduction to Docker and Binder</b><br><br>With the 'reproducibility crisis' in psychology and neuroscience, there is a trend towards publishing one’s data and code along with the associated article — which is great! Often, however, providing your code is not enough to reproduce your analyses, as it may depend on specific software versions, system requirements, or even operating systems. Docker and Binder are two tools that offer a solution for this! Docker allows you to specify an environment (a Docker container) using a 'recipe' (a Dockerfile), containing the particular (Linux-based) operating system (e.g., Ubuntu 18.04), software packages (FSL 6.0.1 and Python 3.6.1 with scikit-learn 0.21.3), and runtime executables (entrypoint, e.g., my_analysis.py) of your choice. Binder is a less 'complete' solution than Docker, but definitely not less useful! With Binder, you can turn your Git(hub) repository into a collection of interactive Jupyter Notebooks, making them instantly reproducibly for anyone. In this workshop, you will get some hands-on experience with writing Dockerfiles and creating Docker containers in a scientific context, as well as getting started with Binder. Some experience with the (Linux) command line interface is useful, but not strictly required.</p>

  <p align="justify" style="font-family: arial;"><br><b>Where to Go Next? The Landscape of Post-PhD Career Tracks</b><br><br>There is a growing disparity between the number of new PhD graduates and the available faculty positions. Effectively, most of the PhD graduates needs to find jobs outside academia. Yet, there is little amount of services dedicated to assisting early career researchers in discovering their core competencies, in searching for employers and landing their dream jobs in industry. Ideally, one should anticipate the potential future market sectors after completing the PhD, and focus on developing transferable skills during the PhD on that basis. This however, remains a rare practice in the graduate schools. Therefore, in this workshop, we will assume that you have no prior experience with the job market in industry. We will discuss the following: the demand for PhDs in different branches of industry; paycheck or entrepreneurship? Is a traineeship at a company a good start after a PhD?; defining your key competences, including both hard- and soft skills; searching for employers who are likely to search for these competences; searching for employers who share your personal values; the role of networking in searching for jobs; restructuring your CV and writing a competitive motivational letter; preparing for job interviews.<br><br>The workshop will be interactive: we will debunk certain myths related to the job market with the use of polls and quizzes. Sharing personal experience by participants will be highly encouraged. The goal of the workshop is to give the participants the information and confidence so they can further search for relevant information on their own, and take their first steps towards finding their dream job in industry.</p>

  <p align="justify" style="font-family: arial;"><br><b>Probing Brain Organization and Function with Neuroimaging Markers of Connectivity (HBP)</b><br><br>Across the past years, many developments arose in connectivity analyses based on MRI data offering now a wide range of connectivity markers. Capitalizing on this wealth of neuroimaging markers, connectivity-based parcellation can be used to unravel the complexity of brain organization. Furthermore, large population-based neuroimaging datasets with extensive psychometric characterization now open promising perspectives to link brain organization to behavior. In particular, interindividual variability in brain’s region functional connectivity can be related to interindividual variability in psychometric data by using a connectivity-based psychometric prediction approach. Despite some challenges associated to the use of these data-driven approaches, they also offer opportunities to better understand the relationships between brain connectivity and human behavior.</p>

  <p align="justify" style="font-family: arial;"><br>In 2002, Stefan received his MSc degree at the University of Twente, Enschede, the Netherlands, at the faculty of mechanical engineering. His MSc-project was on the segmentation of fingerprint images, using Hidden Markov Models. From 2003-2008, he worked as a PhD student on the subject of medical image registration at the Image Sciences Institute, UMC Utrecht, the Netherlands, resulting in a thesis about “Optimisation methods for medical image registration”. An important result was the development (with Marius Staring) of the open-source software package for image registration, <a href="http://elastix.isi.uu.nl">Elastix</a>. Currently in use by several (national and international) research institutions and companies. Since 2008, he works at the Biomedical Imaging Group Rotterdam (<a href="http://www.bigr.nl">BIGR</a>), Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, the Netherlands. There, he is assistant-professor and leading a research line on medical image registration.</p>

  <p align="justify" style="font-family: arial;"><br>Robert's main interest is in developing novel methods for the analysis of MEG and EEG data with applications in cognitive neuroimaging. His scientific contributions include signal processing, source reconstruction, connectivity analysis and statistical analysis. Furthermore, Robert is interested in improving the methodological aspects of cognitive neuroimaging at the meta level: he contributes to the dissemination of state-of-the-art analysis methods by developing open-source software, by data sharing and by organizing educational and scientific workshops. His contributions to the methodological advancement of the field of non-invasive electrophysiology are exemplified by FieldTrip, a project that he started about 10 years ago and that he has been heading since. To strengthen the MEG and EEG research community, Robert is not managing FieldTrip only as a data analysis toolbox, but also as a platform for the exchange of ideas and expertise.</p>

  <p align="justify" style="font-family: arial;"><br>Tim van Mourik is a PostDoc at the Donders Centre for Cognitive Neuroimaging. During his PhD he developed analysis tools to analyse fMRI scans at an even finer level of detail: that of the cortical layers. In doing so, he not only developed the new tools for obtaining laminar signals, but also applications to build graphical pipelines with these tools (<a href="https://timvanmourik.github.io/Porcupine/">Porcupine</a>). In addition, he set up web applications to facilitate sharing fMRI results in augmented reality (<a href="https://armadillo-brain.herokuapp.com">ARmadillo</a>) and improved collaboration on interactive workflows (<a href="https://giraffe.tools">GiraffeTools</a>). At the OHBM conference 2019, Tim was the chair of the Open Science Room and in charge of organising a week long program with talks, discussions, and demos towards open and reproducible research practices.</p>

  <p align="justify" style="font-family: arial;"><br><b>Sharing GDPR Compliant Neuroimaging Research Data</b><br><br>Personal data privacy and research data sharing seem, on the surface, to be at odds. On the one hand the European General Data Protection Regulation provides important regulations for protecting personal information to a high standard, something that we should uphold in multiple facets of life. On the other hand, current principles of transparency and reproducibility in research (in short, open science) suggests that we should publicly share the data underlying our scientific findings. This leaves us with a conundrum: how do we protect the individual's privacy, while allowing others to access and process their data? In this talk I will provide an overview of what has been done at several EU institutions to enable neuroimaging data sharing under GDPR. We will also look at the progress made with a collaborative and open project that aims to provide open templates and resources for informed consent forms, data anonymization techniques, data usage agreements, and more.</p>
