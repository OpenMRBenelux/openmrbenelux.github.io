    title: "The age of the researcher is over. The time of the community has come."
    description:
      "Many people doing research report feeling isolated or experiencing
      mental health difficulties, especially given the great expectations
      we place on ourselves. Although it may be intimidating, being part
      of a community can provide a safety net for people to overcome some
      of these challenges with the help and support of others."

      "The tools are out there for researchers to publish their data and results in rich
      online formats that offer accessibility, interaction and exploration. Yet, we still
      see a majority of standard plots and images in PDF format. In this demo, we will explore
      the possibilities offered by Python, Plotly and Dash to make your research outputs interactive
      and future-aware! See a sneak preview here: https://rt-me-fmri.herokuapp.com/"

      <p>An unconference is a participant-driven meeting. Commonly, participants present their research, project work, or any other topics of current interest in an
      informal setting to other participants. The content of an unconference is usually decided very shortly before or during the meeting itself, often inspired by
      ongoing within-team discussions that could be of interest to the larger group.</p>"

    title: "Agile Academia"
    description:
      "<p>Agile is a software development methodology for teams focused on fast iterations and delivering values-products to end-users or clients.
      Agile is less about planning every step but more about delivering a working product (Minimal Working Product) and iteratively adding new
      features to it. The agile approach is also focused on constant feedback and adjusting plus the transparency of the process?
      Does this approach or elements of it should be implemented more in academia/scientific lab environment? If yes, how this approach
      could be implemented and translated? What may be the obstacles and impediments?</p>

    description: "As researchers, we delightfully go on and on and on, when someone inquires about 
    what it is that we investigate, exactly. Deep down, we already realize that this does a disservice 
    to our aim to express ourselves clearly. Luckily there's hope! All you need is 3 enthusiastic minutes 
    - and a story that sticks."

    I will also slightly hint at references and resources that might be helpful to explore, as 
    starting points to improve visuals and create impactful images."

    session in your living room! Or perhaps you are more of the shower shouter type? Whatever scenario 
    you recognise yourself to be in once in a while, you will notice that you will effortlessly vocalise
    the lyrics of your favourite songs. Doesn’t that sound as a great opportunity for people to memorise 
    your research better? Let’s put our papers in songs, hear all about it in this talk!"

    title: "Ten Simple Rules for Using Twitter as a Scientist"
    description: "You have probably heard it many times from academics who have already discovered the 
    advantages of social media - 'you should be on Twitter'! Next to sharing your research, learning about 
    advances from other fields, and cat pictures, many cite the sense of community as an important reason 
    for being on the platform. Let's say you are already convinced and you made an account - what then? How 
    do you get the most of Twitter, without it consuming all your time and energy? Based on a recent paper 
    with the same name, in this talk I will discuss ten simple ideas that have helped me and other academics 
    do exactly this."

    to engage in science communication."
