      bio: 'My background in psychology and neuroscience inspired me to start walking the path of academic research. After working for several years in the field of neuroimaging as a PhD student (RWTH Aachen, Germany) and postdoc (BCBL, Spain), I am now taking the leap out of academia as a biostatistician. Looking for a contribution to the scientific enterprise from another perspective.'

        title: 'The age of the researcher is over. The time of the community has come'
        content: 'Many people doing research report feeling isolated or experiencing mental health difficulties, especially given the great expectations we place on ourselves. Although it may be intimidating, being part of a community can provide a safety net for people to overcome some of these challenges with the help and support of others.'
