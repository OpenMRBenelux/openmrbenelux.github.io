      bio: 'My background in psychology and neuroscience inspired me to start walking the path of academic research. After working for several years in the field of neuroimaging as a PhD student (RWTH Aachen, Germany) and postdoc (BCBL, Spain), I am now taking the leap out of academia as a biostatistician. Looking for a contribution to the scientific enterprise from another perspective.'

        title: 'The age of the researcher is over. The time of the community has come'
        content: 'Many people doing research report feeling isolated or experiencing mental health difficulties, especially given the great expectations we place on ourselves. Although it may be intimidating, being part of a community can provide a safety net for people to overcome some of these challenges with the help and support of others.'

Next to sharing your research, learning about advances from other fields, and cat pictures, many cite the sense of community as an important reason for being on the platform. Let's say you are already convinced and you made an account - what then? How do you get the most of Twitter, without it consuming all your time and energy? Based on a recent paper with the same name, in this talk I will discuss ten simple ideas that have helped me and other academics do exactly this'
