Whatever scenario you recognise yourself to be in once in a while, you will notice that you will effortlessly vocalise the lyrics of your favourite songs. Doesn’t that sound as a great opportunity for people to memorise your research better? Let’s put our papers in songs, hear all about it in this talk!",

In this panel discussion, we will discuss how to make our research more understandable and transparent for the wider audience.

She received her Ph.D. from Delft University of Technology in 2015. After a postdoc at the Erasmus Medical Center, in 2017 she started as a tenure track assistant professor at Eindhoven University of Technology. In 2020, failing to achieve various metrics, she decided to leave the tenure track of search of a place where she can contribute to open and inclusive science. She recently started as an associate professor at IT University of Copenhagen. Next to research and teaching, Veronika blogs about academic life on https://www.veronikach.com, and gives talks and workshops on failure and related topics."

Next to sharing your research, learning about advances from other fields, and cat pictures, many cite the sense of community as an important reason for being on the platform. Let's say you are already convinced and you made an account - what then? How do you get the most of Twitter, without it consuming all your time and energy? Based on a recent paper with the same name, in this talk I will discuss ten simple ideas that have helped me and other academics do exactly this.",
