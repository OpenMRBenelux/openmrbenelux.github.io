Python and Jupyter Notebooks are becoming more and more essential tools to conduct open and reproducible research. In this workshop, we will first briefly discuss how these tools can facilitate transparent science. Then, we will have a hands-on session where we will code in Jupyter notebook using Python. We will create reproducible workflows using packages that are both basic and specific for medical image analysis (e.g. SimpleITK).
